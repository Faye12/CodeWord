## Codewords Week 12

### Working Progress on major project

To make the text more readable, I reduced the number of words and enlarged the size of the font. And I also applied the variable colours on it so the result presented as a modern dance club look. In addition, I added a song by mouse clicking. I tried use button to play the song instead of mouse click, but the button is too distracted with entire design. In the end, I decided to take away the buttom.

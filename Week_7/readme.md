## Poetics in the Expanded Field: Textual, Visual, Digital...

A new framework, of visual projection, overlays the “speech chain” of the communication model, and we begin to complicate, beyond the possibility of a comprehensive reading, the display with textual blocks and graphic elements that cancel each other out until there is only one exit available—the looming eye at the bottom of the page.

## Paper Prototype Breakdown
1. The screen stars with “speech chain” which is a 3D dimension text ring could be rotated or adjust the gap by mouse movement.

2. Different shapes and words appear one by one and overlay with each other.

3. Textual blocks and shapes automatically drop from one side to the other, meanwhile duplicate itself which creates movement track.

4. Textual block and shapes disappear. There is a textual eye in the end, and the movement of the eye follows the mouse.

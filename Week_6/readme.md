## Codewords Week 6
During the week, I start to read the article I’ve chosen, which is Poetics in the Expanded Field: Textual, Visual, Digital written by Barrett Watten.

A few paragraphs I fount have potential to develop them in visual format:

1.	From here, the analogy and slippery digits of the real are poured into the mouth of the funnel. Though we enter the funnel, we have not yet entered the other, the distant and remote. Flowing further, the variable body, the abstracted and released continuum of the body is compressed, reduced and encoded, codified—made elemental . . .

2.	Now we are small enough, we hope—it is the hope of communification that we minimize the space of flesh—to continue or/in/out/off and away. The exit is an entrance to an open space as wide as the real, though narrow, flat at either extreme. We penetrate the impenetrable and defy time, perhaps even matter. I and nanots, nano- nauts, knots. The reverse of delta.


3.	There are a many screens(pages) between the re:enacting agent and the [sub|ob]ject. Scrims and mirrors, walls and portals block and provide access to remote location(s) of desire. The object is concealed in these hidden places—latency is outside. The eye that is the I looks out (across the ocean) through many layers (of earth and sky), passing through gates and membranes, attaching— entering and exiting. / The static body transmits the intimate details and private fantasies, expressing and requesting the return of locally confirmed re:motions. One is various—rendered completely at [n]either location—here AND there. The mechanism is based upon the provocative im.pulses of an originating, enacting or proactive agent. This is true at [n]either pole.


4.	Scrims and mirrors, walls and portals block and provide access to remote location(s) of desire. The object is concealed in these hidden places—latency is outside. The eye that is the I looks out (across the ocean) through many layers (of earth and sky), passing through gates and membranes, attaching— entering and exiting. 


Finally, I decided I am going to interpret this paragraph because I feel the words here leave me a lot of imagination and visualization:point_down: 

#### A new framework, of visual projection, overlays the “speech chain” of the communication model, and we begin to complicate, beyond the possibility of a comprehensive reading, the display with textual blocks and graphic elements that cancel each other out until there is only one exit available—the looming eye at the bottom of the page.

### Group Activities
We practice making and using paper-prototypes of popular retro 2D video-games in a group activity. Some of us including myself don’t familiar with video game. So we decide to make prototype by choosing the most classic game Asteroid. It is really fun to use paper to demonstrate how the game is functioning. And I also enjoy our classmates demonstrate their game in the class!

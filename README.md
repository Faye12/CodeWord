### Reflection

It is indeed the last studio I have taken before graduation. At the beginning, I was wondering whether it is necessary for me to learn coding as a designer. Although I still could not answer this question simply by yes or no. The class has introduced me to a new technology and thus opened a new door. For me, coding is not a mystery anymore, but something that I could use and apply in my design approach.  

At the beginning, I was amazed by how brilliant other students’ works were and therefore raised  a lot of fear and worry. I was not sure if I could survive the rest of the term. I felt really behind as weeks after weeks without fully understanding of the codes that have been taught. It is the first time I have ever had my hands on coding and tried to deal with the technical aspect by myself. That was really frustrating. I don’t know if I can achieve something that I had initially. That was the most of my stress comes from. But now, I felt glad that I was here when I look back. And I am proud that I pulled off a coding basis project by myself without any previous background.

I experienced so much emotions through this journey: anxiety, anger (especially when codes not working), encouragement, cheer and honour. Great risks create greater results. I have learnt so much from my fellow classmates, not only about the technical skill, but also of the creativity and innovation that they have. They help me to see the ideas that I did not have, and it all comes back in how interactive and engaging the nature of the class is.

It is already hard to study a new thing, and online learning makes it worse. In the end, I have to say it is a fantastic experience and I am really grateful on the amount of efforts that Andy and Karen have put in to engage and interact with the class. This class makes me having more confidence on coding, and my initial fear of codes has been greatly reduced. Now, I have a new toy to play with when dealing with my future design practices, and I am excited to see what else I can come out with when I use coding to create fantastic typography and graphics based design.

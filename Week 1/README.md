## Codewords Week 1

### Class Lecture
From week 1 class, after Andy and Karen showed us the previous coding-design work they did. I was surprised because I though coding is only a mechanical tool that I didn’t expect that it works so well in design field. This class opened a new door for me. Before joined this class, I would never connect design with code. I want to know more about how coding works in design, I started to feel anxious and excited.

### Group Discussion
We were divided as a four people group to discuss the book we read recently. I introduced a logo book that is not only presented us about the successful logo in the world, but also broke down the process and design thinking behind. One of the group member mentioned that he normally read e-books in his own mother tongue. Andy said that learning coding is like learning another language. Probably it would be easier for multilingual speaker. Which relieved me a little bit from the afraid of unfamiliar things.

### Minecraft Walkthrough
After lunch the whole class played around in Minecraft Melbourne. It was my first time to play Minecraft, I felt a bit lost especially when some other classmates showed their skill in the game. After the class I played in library tutorial to learn some basics in Minecraft.

### Coding demonstrate
Karen demonstrated us coding in Processing. As a code beginner, I l felt overwhelming. There was too much information that I need to learn. After the class, I read some tutorial before I jumped into the homework. I tried to figure out the meaning of every single words in Karen’s code. I created my first sketch of the letter F.

## Codewords Week 10

### Working Progress on major project

Each of us presented our code in progress to the class. I received some great feedback from Andy, Karen and the class. They suggested me use camera tracking instead of literally making an eyes in the end (according to the article I choose).


Andy showed us some great reference in the typographic consultation. Karen showed me her code example of camera tracking. Actually I felt stuck before the class, but luckily I knew how to continue with my current code after the class ends. And also I don’t feel that stress like last week.

There were a lot of great works in the class. I learnt a lot by observing other student’s work. This week, I will continue working on camera tracking based on [the code I’ve done.](https://faye12.github.io/CodeWord/majorProject/majorProject_tryout5/)

### Try out poseNet

I found some PoseNet reference online, but I can't play it on my computer. But luckily I am able to talk to Jackie in the class, she was general to share with me the library I had to import before working on PoseNet. I tried to make the camera shape become a circle, so it looked more like a looming eye.

My original idea is let the textual looming eye follow human's movement, so it gives a feeling that someone is watching you. This is what I made below, but I found the computer was super laging, and the movement was not that smooth, so I had to drop off this idea.

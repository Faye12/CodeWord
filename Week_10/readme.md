## Codewords Week 10

### Working Progress on major project

Each of us presents our code in progress to the class. I received some great feedback from Andy, Karen and the class. They suggest me use camera tracking instead of literally making an eyes in the end (according to the article I choose).


Andy showed us some great reference in the typographic consultation. Karen showed me her code example of camera tracking. Actually I feel stuck before the class, but luckily I know how to continue with my current code after the class ends. And also I don’t feel that stress like last week.

There are a lot of great work in the class.  I learn a lot by observing other student’s work. This week, I will continue working on camera tracking based on [the code I’ve done.](https://faye12.github.io/CodeWord/majorProject/majorProject_tryout5/)

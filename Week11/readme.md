## Codewords Week 10

### Working Progress on major project

To speed up the loading, I made the textual looming eye follow by mouse movement instead of tracking by camera.

After made this, I was thinking anything else I could add on to make it more interesting.

What I wanted to improve here:
1. song autoplay when it loads instead of mousepress; 2. differentiate the texture of foreground box and backgound rotating text 3. the mousemovement only affect backgound rotating text, not foreground box.

so I consulted Karen, see whether she could me some suggestions. Karen replied me very fast, she said curently processing doesn't support auto play, and if I wanted to differentiate the texture and movement, I have to sepereate the canvas. And she suggested me to take a look at the muti-canvas test she did before.

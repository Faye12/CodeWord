## Codewords Week 2

### Class Lecture & Group Discussion
Andy showcased modular typeface ranging from the Bauhaus to contemporary designers working in algorithmic typography. At the beginning, I didn’t understand clearly what is algorithmic typeface. I got lost when Andy asked us to collect our own example. After research, I realised algorithmic typographic is a mathematician comes up with a set of formulate that define attributes for the whole batch instead of designers’ artistic sensibilities. Algorithmic typeface helps us save plenty time and give us more freedom to experiment different art form.

### Example of Modular Typeface Designs
Wim Crouwel is one of the great Dutch design icons who analysed his approach and explored his innovative use of grid-base layouts and typographic system to produce consistently striking asymmetric visuals.

###### *In Fernand Leger, Crouwel shared a sense of order and a basic aesthetic.*

Wim Crouwel is a virtuoso of experimentation, who combined rigorous structural logics with meaningful expressiveness, showing an extraordinary mastery in color and typography, making letters becoming wonderful images.

###### *Designed to promote an exhibition titled “Vormgevers” (Form Givers, i.e. Designers). It has become a graphic design classic, and probably the best-known poster designed by Wim Crouwel.*

###### *Crouwel created the font as an experiment followed with grid-based letterforms, inspired by his interest in crystallography and the crystal structures of the patterns generated by early computer technology. 

### House of Leaves
My group is working on the introduction part of House of Leaves. House of leave is a thrilled novel written by Mark Z. Danielwski. I personally love suspense thriller. So when I read the introduction part, I was scared but addicted by the book. I read the chapter twice and listed down all the key point on notebook to fully understand the article. Each group member worked on different part of the script and posted the summary on Google doc.

### Coding Homework
In the homework, we were asked to choose one of other sketch on Google slide and made small changes. I decided to choose Napasorn’s letter “N” by changing its colours, shapes and movement.

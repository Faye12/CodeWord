## Codewords Week 4

### Processing workshop 
My confidence was destroyed into pieces every time when Karen taught us Processing. I felt out of control and overwhelming, but I understood that it was good chance for me to step out of the comfort zone.

### Assignment 2
Our group continue working on the Minecraft. Before jumping to the production, all of us went through the entire script together to make sure all of us in the same pace. We distributed the workload by the production team and creative team. And I was involved in the production, record and edit for I had a motion background. Although we were not able to meet face by face, but we worked closely with each other through Google doc and Facebook. For example, I was not that familiar with Minecraft but other group mates were general to share their knowledge to assist me in the game. Although we planed well in the styleframe, but there were still some results we couldn’t achieve in Minecraft. Therefore, we would always come back and discuss about another solution together. In fact, I didn’t expect a remote group work would be so smooth.

Google doc was also an open space for us to share and communicate our ideas.

## Codewords Week 9

### Working Progress on major project

I feel extremely stress this week. My idea is based on 3D perspective. But Karen didn’t teach us much about 3D. I have no choice but have to spend plenty of time on watching online tutorial. Meanwhile I am also searching for good reference, and try to modify from their script. I feel down for I am not familiar with coding. I don’t really make progress at the beginning. Because I can’t fully understand the codes of the reference.

I am panic especially notice that some of our classmate are quite good with coding. I try to understand the reference script and try to hide the text to test its function. I follow the coding tutorial and test them in my own processing. Every time I don’t understand the function I always go back and check tutorial.

I explore shapes and text in 3D camera.

After these experiments, I realise I have to tweak my original idea of text rings since I can’t find a way to write the text on the circle in 3D perspective. So I decide either use image on text as texture apply on the 3D shape instead.
